##  Python is a general purpose language

    A programming language used for building software in a wide 
    variety of application domains.

    Python is a GPL because it can be used to write desktop software,
    create web applications, data science, ML etc.

    As opposed to general purpose programming language, we also have domain specific
    programming languages (DSL) as well like SQL.

    DSL are used within a specific area, i.e sql can only be used for querying relational
    database and nothing else.
